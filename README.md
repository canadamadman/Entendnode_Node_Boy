I designed this for fun, thought it would be funny to make it look like a old game system.

A PCB design that is based off the DIY Pro-Micro, Firmware for Meshtastic. This is a smd version that can be ordered and just need to add the promicro and the lora chip(HT-RA62 footprint). Battery holder will also be needed separately as well. I'm open to improvements and modifications.
